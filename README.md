# SmallGameFramework

The SmallGameFramework provides the basic tools to quickly kick-off an SFML game project.

This project is not a library where you code against an API, instead it provides a set of classes that you can and
should directly use for your project. The name is a reference to my
[SmallGameEngine](https://github.com/eXpl0it3r/SmallGameEngine), which in itself is more a proof of concept and is
often too complex for simple games. The SmallGameFramework could be especially useful for the
[SFML Game Jam](https://sfmlgamejam.com/), [Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com/) or any other game jam where you
intend to use SFML.
